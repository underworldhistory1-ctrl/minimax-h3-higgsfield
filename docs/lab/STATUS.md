# Reviewed status — 2026-10-03

2026-10-08 update: this is a historical review. The later local Refine integration and installer changes are described in [Connected Studio](../CONNECTED_STUDIO.md); they do not establish live GPU quality.

This document supersedes the f1042d2 handoff's claim that every task was completed. That commit passed helper tests while its main UI, graph submission, projects, cancellation and continuation integration had blocking defects.

The follow-up implements connected workspace/project/asset/queue/guide/continuation paths and fixes the observed security and data-loss defects. See ARCHITECTURE.md and REVIEW_HANDOFF.md for final contracts; see TEST_REPORT.md for actual evidence.

| Gate | State |
|---|---|
| Source review and corrective implementation | Completed locally in the lab |
| Python service/HTTP/context/FFmpeg checks | 92 tests passed |
| JS helper contracts and syntax | 27 tests passed |
| Real Chromium CPU browser acceptance | Passed; final replay after changes recorded in TEST_REPORT.md |
| Isolated online deployment | Deployed on isolated port 8190; live browser save/reload passed; full GPU process intentionally not started |
| GPU generation, latent/video context continuation, reference/keyframe output quality | Pending |
| Multi-clip perceptual seams and lip sync | Pending |
| Latent Upscaler and AudioRefine integration/quality | Not implemented; investigation only |
| Production promotion | Blocked until the relevant live gates pass |

Production code, queues, model files and service processes remain unchanged. A separate private V2 repository was created at https://github.com/underworldhistory1-ctrl/minimax-h3-higgsfield-v2. No weights or CUDA packages were installed locally; CPU test tensors and synthetic media do not constitute model inference.

Online editing acceptance: V2 header/standby banner, disabled video and image generation, actual server-owned project save/reload, zero uncaught browser errors. Both /prompt and /h3_studio/lab/jobs reject inference with HTTP 403. Existing H3 and LTX process IDs remained alive.

Final external-source workflow implemented: upload/prepare/private root take, separated storyboard and timed-keyframe controls, explicit checkpoint re-encode, canvas/mode compatibility, cancellation-safe worker completion. Additional 8 Chromium CPU journeys passed.
